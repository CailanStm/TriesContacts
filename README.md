##Tries: Contacts

This is my solution to the Tries: Contacts problem on HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-contacts/problem). This data structure allows you to do quick adds of contacts and lookups of contact prefixes. Caching the number of times each node has been involved in an insertion is what makes this data structure work efficiently on lookup.
